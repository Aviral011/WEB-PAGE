        One day Jesus wanted to teach people how to stay strong even when
        hard<br />
        things happen. He told them a story about a big storm, a wise man, and
        a<br />
        foolish man. When the storm came, the wise man's house did not fall
        down<br />
        because it was built on a rock. But the foolish man's house fell down<br />
        because it was built on sand.<br />

        We follow the story of Song Lang, a genius in the police field, who
        due<br />
        to unfortunate circumstances caused by his mortal enemy, now assumes
        the<br />
        identity of a driver named Chen Shi. Although he had wanted to live
        out<br />
        his days as an ordinary citizen, fate has other plans in store for
        him.<br />

        Global exploration started with the Portuguese discoveries of the<br />
        Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, the coast of Africa,<br />
        and the discovery of the sea route to India in 1498. This was
        followed<br />
        by the trans-Atlantic Voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas<br />
        between 1492 and 1502 and the first circumnavigation of the globe in
        the<br />
        early 16th century. These discoveries led to numerous naval
        expeditions<br />
        across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions
        in<br />
        the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia that continued into the
        late<br />
        19th century, and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in
        the<br />
        20th century. Let us relive the stories of 16 of the most famous<br />
        explorers in the history of humankind.
